# safeDialogs
safeDialogs prevents the server from receiving fake or spoofed dialog responses. This includes faking dialog ID, listitem or even the inputtext in cases of lists. Faking listitem or inputtext can lead to many risks of user breaking into server security depending on how they're used. This include ensures that everything's safe and also contains a callback that is triggered whenever player sends spoofed dialog response.
